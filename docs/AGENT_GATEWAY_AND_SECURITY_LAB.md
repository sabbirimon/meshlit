# Gateway and Linux Security Lab implementation — 2026-10-07
<!-- meshlit-document-tracking:start -->
Tracking reconciled 2026-10-12: [Plan](../PLAN.md) · [Progress](../PROGRESS.md) · [Document status](DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md).
Scope: Android/shared reference; desktop ports have separate acceptance. Phase labels in older sections retain their original scope.
<!-- meshlit-document-tracking:end -->

This continuation implements an initial working subset of the approved full plan.
Do not describe the entire cyber suite or upstream Rust gateway as embedded.

Settings routes: Agent Gateway, Commands and instructions, Security Lab, Lab packages.

## Built-in protocol endpoints

`GatewayHost` wires `EmbeddedGateway` to real durable AgentBackend jobs, models and
assessment/package repositories. Listener is authenticated loopback only, manually
started while the Gateway screen is open. Leaving screen stops it and requests
cancellation of owned active jobs. No foreground service or remote public listener.
Play Review refuses inbound start. No first-use acceptance bypass.

MCP: stateless JSON-response Streamable HTTP subset, initialize/ping/tools/list/
tools/call and initialized notification. GET SSE is explicitly 405; unsupported
methods fail. Versions 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18, 2025-11-25. Owner token is shared by
configured clients; per-client credentials, OAuth/JWT and server notifications remain
future work. Tools: typed command submit/job status/cancel, delegated assessment
list/run and allowlisted pip package actions. Normal saved command delegation still
applies. Lab tools additionally require a running SSH-ready isolated VM.

A2A: advertised 0.3 JSON-RPC model-task subset, Agent Card, message/send,
tasks/get and tasks/cancel. No task streaming, push, arbitrary modalities or external
agent federation. Restart does not replay tasks. Gateway-owned IDs stay session-local;
encrypted underlying job journal survives but old tasks are not exposed after restart.

LLM: /v1/models and /v1/chat/completions buffered text for the owner-selected model.
Installed local or enabled cloud profile IDs are routed through the real backend.
Actual streaming/tools/Responses compatibility remains a further milestone.

All endpoints require Bearer token, reject browser Origin headers, enforce request
bounds and bounded concurrent handlers. Rotating token stops old listener.
Content policy uses bounded literal input/output rules. Empty filtered/custom rules
provide no moderation classifier. Minimal skips optional rules, never auth/permissions.
Hosted provider policy and model learned behavior are unchanged.

## Manual commands and instructions

Runtime commands use existing RuntimeHost: APP, explicit per-command human root,
PRoot/Bubblewrap and VM configuration. Pinned SSH host selection uses SshConnections.
Input is never executed until Run. Stop propagates cancellation; completed side effects
and remote descendants are not guaranteed rolled back. Output is screen-local.
Natural-language instructions submit a real model-generation human job; they do not
automatically become shell commands or an autonomous tool-calling loop.

## Security Lab and packages

Lab only runs with VM_SSH and SSH_READY, for rooted/non-rooted phones. PRoot, APP,
root and root-chroot alone do not establish isolation. Guest must already have SSH,
Python, timeout/base64 and installed companion scripts. No Kali/Parrot image or
native QEMU installer is bundled. VM startup/resource policy remains independently
configured, and phone native-runtime/guest acceptance remains open.

Assessment records are encrypted, digest/path/tool/expiry scoped with independent
agent permission. Implemented adapters: original APK inventory, classic-PCAP summary,
optional installed tshark and Sleuth Kit fsstat (raw filesystem-image metadata only). Prior requested tools remain catalogued as planned:
Androguard, Quark, Objection/Frida, Drozer, Metasploit, Havoc reports, Magisk,
Atomic Red Team, Autopsy UI/advanced Sleuth Kit recovery, qualified dynamic sandbox and PCAPdroid.

Package operations run only in the ready VM using an explicitly provisioned guest
marker. Manual pip/apt/apk/dnf/pacman list/install/uninstall; managers must be installed
and compatible. pip has a dedicated non-root venv. Distro root operations require
explicit human guest-root approval; no automatic sudo. Repo names or SHA-checked
file/web artifacts. Phone SAF transfer copies to a unique guest /tmp artifact and
computes a digest. Dependency trust is inherited from guest repositories/indexes.

Agent package operations additionally require saved VM activation plus a one-hour
owner allowlist of pip names. Root distro operations/arbitrary file or web installs
are not delegated. Uninstall leaves possible configs/dependencies/evidence/staged files.
Guest networking defaults restricted, with a human-only outbound opt-in configured while stopped and applied at next VM start. QEMU snapshots discard guest changes on stop by default; explicit human persistent mode writes changes to the supplied qcow2 disk. One-click
Alpine/Kali/Parrot/Ubuntu/RHEL provisioning remain open.

## Verified VM setup artifacts

Lab packages can import opaque VM artifacts from Android storage or exact HTTPS.
Owner supplies publisher SHA-256 and exact byte size (up to 8 GiB); copies are bounded
and cancellable, checksum-verified and atomically committed. No redirects, URL
credentials/query/fragment, extraction or execution. Failed/aborted staging is removed.
Thirty-minute import deadline and storage headroom apply. Configure the saved artifact
path through Runtime; this is not a distro image catalogue or an Android QEMU installer.
Disk mode changes are human-only while stopped: `vm storage ephemeral|persistent`.
Persistent mode retains writes, including package state; default ephemeral mode
discards boot-session changes. Neither mode proves phone/VM qualification.

## Upstream and remaining full-plan work

Official agentgateway v1.6.0 Linux assets pinned in companions/agentgateway; fetching
verifies digests and does not execute. Host runtime tests pending (no Docker daemon,
Mac x86_64 without matching reviewed Darwin binary). Android Rust embedding requires
Bionic cross-compilation and native packaging, not a Linux binary copy.
Remote MCP/OAuth/session/SSE federation, remote A2A delegation, streaming LLM tool loop,
Responses, enforceable cross-client cost budgets, moderation-service adapters and
physical-device/provider proof remain acceptance milestones.


The APK now includes the original Python companions as data assets. Lab packages
has a human-only Install/update action: requires explicit guest-root approval,
an already ready VM, pinned SSH configured for its root account, base64/sha256sum
and /usr/local/bin. Bytes are hash-checked before same-directory rename. No sudo,
agent setup delegation or execution of downloaded installers. Marker is created
only after both copies complete; failures can leave partial updates and are reported.
Runtime guest actions require the active VM forwarding port. Grants now include
SSH account/identity selection and host-key pin contents; changing them invalidates
the grant. Persistent Stop is not a clean guest shutdown or a rollback; shut down
inside the guest and preserve backups when consistency matters.
